# Color settings for the Cygwin mintty terminal

Based on the solarized color scheme by Ethan Schoonover. See full
details at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

Copy the two files into a directory in your home (for example .solar) 
and add one of the following lines to your .bashrc file:

source ~/.solar/sol.light

or

source ~/.solar/sol.dark

Color schemes can be swapped interactively using the same commands.
